# Deep Learning: Architectures & Methods volunteer project

A project where I build a Neural Network using tensorflow.
This network is then analyzed using tensorboard.

To start the network use the variable_analyzer_nn.py file and call the main() function.

To start Tensorboard type:

`tensorbaord --log-dir="tensorflow_logs/train_mnist/" `
