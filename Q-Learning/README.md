# Q-Learning with pong

A self written pong game learned to play using Q-Learning.
Recent files have been added in the **pong/** folder.

Old project repaired to make it runable. The **pong/main.py** file runs the game and starts learning, while the **pong/pong.py** contains all classes for the pong game.

The files directly ini this folder are mainly used for testing.
