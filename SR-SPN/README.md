# SR-SPN

In this folder two Code examples from the project of my bachelorthesis are provided.
Since the idea behind this network is still in research, only simple code examples will be provided.
Nevertheless will this provide an example on how my code is designed and will show my code writing style. I hold on to the PEP8 conventions provided for Python.
All of the provided code is not ment to be published, which is why it is only briefly documented.
