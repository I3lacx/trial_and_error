# Git Guide

This is a small Git guide to list and explain some basic concepts using git.
This file is not ment as a tutorial, its more of a guideline for me

>'git checkout -- <file>'
Remove changes from your commit

>'git checkout <commit-number>'
Visit a branch to the time of the given commit

>'git commit -m "<message>"'
Commit your current changes

>'git status'
Check what is and what isn't commited + check if there are new things from the repo

>'git log'
Check your old commits in a list

>'git commit --amend'
Modify your last commit message

>'git reset HEAD~<number>'
This will uncommit your old changes from the last <number> commits
