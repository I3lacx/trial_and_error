# Git Guide

This is a small Git guide to list and explain some basic concepts using git.
This file is not ment as a tutorial, its more of a guideline for me

`git checkout -- <file>`

Remove changes from your commit

`git checkout <commit-number>`

Visit a branch to the time of the given commit

`git commit -m "<message>`

Commit your current changes

`git status`

Check what is and what isn't commited + check if there are new things from the repo

`git log`

Check your old commits in a list

`git commit --amend`

Modify your last commit message


`git reset HEAD~<number>`

This will uncommit your old changes from the last <number> commits
